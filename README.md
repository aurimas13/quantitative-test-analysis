# Quantitative Test Analysis

This repository contains an in-depth Python-based solution to identify errors in a hypothetical portfolio dataset. 
Errors include inconsistent prices, incorrect trade records, incorrect weight calculations, and other anomalies.

## Folder Structure
- **data/**: Placeholder for the dataset (replace with actual data).
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks detailing the analysis.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for automated error detection.
- **reports/**: Summary of detected errors and insights.

## How to Use
1. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Run the automated error detection script:
```bash
python scripts/detect_errors.py
```
3. Open Jupyter notebook for step-by-step analysis:
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/error_detection.ipynb
```
